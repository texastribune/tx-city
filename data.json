He found Employee #1 slumped over on his side and the coworker called the supervisor. Emergency medical personnel were summoned. The supervisor performed CPR until the EMS arrived, which was approximately 30 minutes. They were unable to revive him.

      "Summary": "At 12:30 a.m. on April 2nd, while the seven outside personnel were still performing A/B/C heat exchanger bank startup operations, the E heat exchanger on the adjacent, in-service bank catastrophically ruptured. The operator in the NHT control room told the CSB that he felt the impacts of the rupture at his desk 350 feet away. The CSB determined that at the time of the incident two of the outside operators were likely on the top level of the heat exchanger structure (Figure 10), and the remaining five operators were most likely at ground level. All seven outside operations personnel were badly burned, and within 22 days of the incident, all succumbed to their injuries.",

Employee #1 closed the block valves as instructed.

Another operator was instructed to close the valve on Tank 300-1 to stop the flow of water to the pond. Employee #1 traveled in a Ford F150 pickup truck to the pond, when he encountered high water, but he continued to drive the same route and drove into the pond. Employee #1 notified his supervisor by radio that he drove the vehicle into a \"ditch\", when actually Employee #1 was in the pond. He stated he was OK at approximately 10:30 p.m. Employee #1 called the supervisor again to inquire on how long it would be before someone would get to him. The supervisor stated an arrival time of a few minutes. Employee #1 replied again that he was OK. The approximate time was between 10:45 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. This was the last radio transmission between Employee #1 and other employees. Follow-up transmissions could not reach Employee #1. At approximately 11:00 p.m., attempts were made by employees who arrived on the scene to locate Employee #1. The water was high and there were no lights in the area except the headlights of the two vehicles searching for Employee #1. Employee #1 and the F150 he was driving were not visible. At approximately 11:05 p.m., a request for rescue personnel to respond to an incident at the north pond was made.

In this particular contract, employer was given the task of cleaning waste tanks. Employees #1 through #3 were on the night shift on the night of the accident. After the tanks had been emptied of water, the employees descended into the tanks one by one to manually pick up solid debris. The actual worksite is an area which had several tanks or pits. The pits were of different configurations: there were rectangular, square as well as round pits, varying in depth from 15 to 30 ft. While the pits were separated by concrete walls, they were connected together at the bottom but were guarded by gates. After coming out of a 15 ft pit, Employee #1 was resting on the perimeter of the pits, preparing to enter into a 30 ft pit. He was wearing a body harness with a lanyard. Employee #1 was a six foot tripod, an emergency rescue equipment, leaning against a post. Upon seeing that his coworkers were having difficulty setting up a ladder for the next descend, Employee #1 walked across the top of the walls of the pits to help Employee #2 and Employee #3 out. As he walked across, employee #1, somehow pulled the tripod with him, the tripod fell and dropped into one of the pits, pulling him down with it. Before Employee #1 fell into the hole, his head hit the lip of the 29-in. wide pit, causing him to die of blunt head trauma. It is not clear whether his landyard got entangled with the tripod or that Employee #1 had hooked both his lanyard caribeeners into the tripod. According to refinery management, when the tripod was retrieved out of the pit, both caribeeners of the lanyard of Employee #1 were found hooked up to the tripod.",

Employees #1 and #2 were working from a scaffold when they were exposed to strong hydrogen sulfide emissions from the vessel. Employee #1 staggered away, but within minutes had lapsed into unconsciousness and died. Employee #2 managed to escape and reach grade level. He was hospitalized for observation and released with no lasting effects. The vessel had accumulated sour gas from a connected overhead gas line, tied into nearby sulfur trains that were operating at relatively low pressure. The source was a single leaking 12 in. gate valve that had been closed and locked out. Employees #1 and #2 were working without respiratory protection or gas detection equipment. The valve inspection program, lockout/tagout program, and respiratory protections were found lacking. At the time of the accident, the foreman was also overseeing other crews at the site.",

While workers were in the process of replacing the pipe, the naphtha was released and burst into flame, killing the four workers. At the time of the fire, workers were positioned on scaffolding up to a hundred feet off the ground and had limited means of escape.\n\n",

Three employees in the feed prep unit-Ellis Thornburg, Charles Hall, and Kevin Smith-were severely injured and sent to the Lubbock Burn Center. As a result of the explosion, Charles received third degree burns over fifty percent of his body, which caused his death eight days later on April 9, 1996.",
